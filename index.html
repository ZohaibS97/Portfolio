                full time employed with passion to become a web developer who has decided to learn web development through online resources such as udemy.com, w3school.com, freecodecamp.com, etcâ€¦<br>
                Currently I have learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and decided to start doing projects so I can apply the skills learned by now to be able to improve and gather some hands-on experience with coding.<br>
                I decided to start with building a simple portfolio by only using HTML,CSS and JavaScript while trying to make it as interactive as possible with the current knowledge.<br>
                After completing my portfolio projects I will start building small website projects to add into my portfolio to show the skill and knowledge I have.
